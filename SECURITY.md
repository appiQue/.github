# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of our packages seriously. If you've discovered a security vulnerability in one of our packages, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

## How to Report

Please report security vulnerabilities by email to:

**security@appique.nl**

We accept reports in both English and Dutch.

Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, pull requests, or any other public channel.

## What to Include

To help us understand and resolve the issue as quickly as possible, please include as much of the following information as you can:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Affected versions
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- If possible, a proof of concept
- Any thoughts on a possible fix (if you have them)

The more information you provide, the faster we can work towards a solution.

## What to Expect

After you submit a report, here's what will happen:

1. We'll acknowledge receipt of your report as soon as possible
2. We'll investigate the issue and assess its impact and severity
3. We'll work on a fix for all actively maintained versions
4. Once the fix is ready, we'll coordinate the release and disclosure with you

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you:

- Give us reasonable time to address the issue before making any information public
- Don't exploit the vulnerability beyond what's necessary to demonstrate it
- Keep the issue confidential until we've released a fix

We believe in coordinated disclosure and will work with you to ensure the vulnerability is disclosed responsibly after a fix is available.

## Thank You

We genuinely appreciate your effort and responsible disclosure. Keeping our packages secure is a community effort, and your contribution helps keep all users safe.

If you have any questions about this process, please don't hesitate to reach out to security@appique.nl.
